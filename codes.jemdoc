- [https://bitbucket.org/chao_chen/hodlr_gpu/src/master/ HODLR_GPU], GPU algorithm for solving HODLR linear systems.

- [https://github.com/ut-padas/rchol rchol], randomized Cholesky factorization for solving SDD linear systems.

- [https://github.com/ruoxi-wang/PBBFMM3D Parallel FMM], parallel black-box fast multipole method (FMM) for share-memory machines implemented with OpenMP.

- [https://github.com/ut-padas/pyrknn Randomized KNN], parallel KNN on GPU.

#- [https://github.com/Charles-Chao-Chen/bbFMM bbFMM], 3D black-box fast multipole method for dislocation dynamics simulation.


- [https://github.com/Charles-Chao-Chen/fastSolver2 Parallel fast solver], parallel code for a fast solver for weakly admissible hierarchical matrices (HODLR). (the implementation uses a new runtime library called [http://legion.stanford.edu legion]. The goal is to have a portable high performance code on distributed heterogeneous architectures.)
