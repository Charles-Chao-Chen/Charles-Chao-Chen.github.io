<h1>MA 402 (001) Spring 2024 Mathematics of Scientific Computing </h1>
<p>Instructor: Chao Chen</p>
<p>Email: chao_chen@ncsu.edu (Please include course number in the subject.)</p>
<p>Times: Monday Wednesday 3:00PM - 4:15PM</p>
<p>Location: 330 Dabney Hall</p>
<p>Office hours: SAS 4236, MW 1:00PM - 2:00PM and by appointment </p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p>This course will provide an overview of methods to solve quantitative problems and analyze data. The tools to be introduced are mathematical in nature and have links to Algebra, Analysis, Geometry, Graph Theory, Probability and Topology. Students will acquire an appreciation of (1) the fundamental role played by mathematics in countless applications and (2) the exciting challenges in mathematical research that lie ahead in the analysis of large data and uncertainties. In particular, 5 main topics are</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Round-off error, conditioning, and norms</p>
</li>
<li><p>Singular value decomposition</p>
</li>
<li><p>Least squares</p>
</li>
<li><p>Monte Carlo methods</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fourier analysis</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p>(MA 341 or MA 405) and programming proficiency (Matlab, Python, C/C++, Java, R, Julia, &hellip;). While this is NOT a programming course, the homework assignments will involve a substantial programming component.</p>

LaTeX can help produce beautifully typeset documents and is particularly useful for communicating mathematics. I highly encourage you to learn it.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Numerical grade = 5 problem sessions (10%) + 5 homework (50%) + midterm (15%) + final (25%)</p>
<p>Letter grade</p>
<ul>
<li><p>97 and above is A+, starting from 93 and below 97 is A, starting from 90 and below 93 is A-. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Similar for the B, C, and D ranges. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Anything below 60 is F.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Problem sessions</dt>
<dd><p>There will be an in-class problem session after each unit. During this session, students work through a problem sheet in groups of 2-3 (open book/notes). All members will receive the same grade. Every student needs to be in a different group each session. Submissions will be due the next day before 11:59 PM.</p></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Homework</dt>
<dd><p>There will be 5 assignments, one for each unit. Again, students work in groups of 2-3. All members will receive the same grade. Every student needs to be in a different group for every homework (it could be the same group in a problem session). Each submission should be a professional looking document (preferably using LaTeX). Thinking of how to best present your results (e.g., what and how to plot) is part of the assignment.</p></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Midterm</dt>
<dd><p>The midterm will be held on Wednesday, February 28. It will be in-class and closed book. Please let me know ASAP if you can not make it and need to schedule a make-up exam.</p></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Final</dt>
<dd><p>The final exam will be held at 3:30PM - 6:00PM on Monday, April 29. It will be closed book. The final exam can NOT be rescheduled for any reason.</p></dd>
</dl>
<h2>Moodle</h2>
<p>Lecture notes and homework assignments will be posted on Moodle. </p>
<h2>Panopto</h2>
<p>Lectures will be videotaped and made available via <a href="https://ncsu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=ca4c8ce2-8797-4e43-98b9-b0d50176147e">Panopto</a>. </p>
<h2>Homework submission instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Please submit your projects by 11:59 PM on the due date. You should submit it on Moodle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If you notice an error in your project, you can use the &ldquo;Edit submission&rdquo; button prior to the due date/time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Please mention the names of your group mates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>PDF is the only accepted format for homework files. You may find &ldquo;save as PDF&rdquo; or &ldquo;print to PDF&rdquo; useful if your file is not already in that format. You may submit only one file per homework. Applications such as acrobat or preview easily allow to concatenate existing PDF files if needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Your file must be titled 402_lastname_HW#. If I were to turn in Homework 1, my file would be 402_chen_HW1.pdf.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The use of LaTeX is strongly encouraged; for each homework, you will be given access to not only a PDF file but also to the LaTeX file that was used to generate it. You can use that LaTeX file as a starting point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Hand written assignments are acceptable but should be scanned. Cell phone quality photos may be rejected. Hand drawn graphs to display computational results are not acceptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Your submission should be standalone: it should contain code, figures, and the output from the code. Please do not expect us to run your code; we will only run the code if something doesn't make sense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>If your file is too large or unreadable, it may be rejected, in which case, you may resubmit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Late submissions are not accepted.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Written communication assessment</h2>
<p>Students in this course will complete a written communication assessment on March 6th, 2024. The assessment is completed online. You will need to bring your laptop to class, but you do not need to study or otherwise prepare. This is an important element of the assessment of the NC State University <a href="https://assessment.dasa.ncsu.edu/assessment-at-nc-state-for-students/">Pack Proficiencies</a>. You are encouraged to do your best work! This information will help us determine the impact of our programs and guide future decisions regarding the education of students in the college of sciences. This assessment is administered by the DASA Assessment office.  If you have an accessibility letter and require accommodations, please contact Madalene Compton at mtadams2@ncsu.edu. DASA Assessment will also provide laptops to students who need them to complete the assessment.</p>
<h2>Academic integrity and honesty</h2>
<p>Students are required to comply with the university policy on academic integrity found in the <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01/">Code of Student Conduct 11.35.01 sections 8 and 9</a>. Therefore, students are required to uphold the Pack Pledge: “I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this test or assignment.” Violations of academic integrity will be handled in accordance with the <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-11-35-02/">Student Discipline Procedures</a>.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://studentconduct.dasa.ncsu.edu/academic-integrity-overview/">Academic Integrity</a> web page for a detailed explanation of the University’s policies on academic integrity and some of the common understandings related to those policies.</p>
<h2>Students with Disavilities</h2>
<p>Reasonable accommondations will be made for students with verifiable disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with the <a href="https://dro.dasa.ncsu.edu/">Disability Servic3es Office</a>. For more information on NC State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-01/">Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation</a>.</p>
